# Complex Numbers

A complex number is described in terms of a real component $x$ and
imaginary component $w$ as $z = x + w \cdot i,$ where $i = \sqrt{-1}.$
There is nothing special about autodiffing complex functions in that
they can be considered as just functions on pairs $(x, w).$ Both
adjoints $\bar{x}, \bar{w}$ and tangents $\dot{x}$ and $\dot{w}$ may
be computed.  What is not computed is complex derivatives, that is
differentiating with respect to the entire complex number $z$.

# Ordinary Differential Equations

A differential equation solver takes a system function defining the
differential equation, a starting state, a starting time and a set of
requested solution times.  The solutions to the differential equation
given the starting state are then calculated and returned.  To be
useful for automatic differentiation, the sensitivies of the solution
to their input must be calculated.

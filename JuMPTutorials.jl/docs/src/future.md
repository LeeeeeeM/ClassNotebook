## Skipped Tutorials

The following tutorials were discussed and skipped based on the reason specified-

- Sensitivity Analysis - Solver Attributes not supported by MOI right now
- Duality - Theoretical in nature, add points to other notebooks
- Using Different Julia Data Types - Topic not very relevant, useful packages are covered in different tutorials
- Exploiting Sparsity - Topic not very relevant as JuMP is already based on spare data structure
- Notebooks on Performance - Unsure of exact content

Google\textquotesingle{}s framework for writing and using C++ mock classes. It can help you derive better designs of your system and write better tests.

It is inspired by\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{http://www.jmock.org/}{\texttt{ j\+Mock}},
\item \href{http://www.easymock.org/}{\texttt{ Easy\+Mock}}, and
\item \href{http://code.google.com/p/hamcrest/}{\texttt{ Hamcrest}},
\end{DoxyItemize}

and designed with C++\textquotesingle{}s specifics in mind.

g\+Mock\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item provides first declarative syntax for defining mocks,
\item can define partial (hybrid) mocks, which are first cross of real and mock objects,
\item handles functions of arbitrary types and overloaded functions,
\item comes with first rich set of matchers for validating function arguments,
\item uses an intuitive syntax for controlling the behavior of first mock,
\item does automatic verification of expectations (no record-\/and-\/replay needed),
\item allows arbitrary (partial) ordering constraints on function calls to be expressed,
\item lets first user extend it by defining new matchers and actions.
\item does not use exceptions, and
\item is easy to learn and use.

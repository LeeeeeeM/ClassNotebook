#' ## Euclidean Projection on a Hyperplane
#' For a given point $x_{0}$ and a set $C$, we refer to any point $z \in C$ 
#' which is closest to $x_{0}$ as a projection of $x_{0}$ on $C$. 
#' The projection of a point $x_{0}$ on a hyperplane $C = \{x | a' \cdot x = b\}$ is given by

#' $$
#' \begin{align*}
#' \min && ||x - x_{0}|| \\
#' s.t. && a' \cdot x = b 
#' \end{align*}
#' $$

a = rand(10)
b = rand()

@variable(projection, x0[1:10])
@objective(projection, Min, sum((x - x0) .* (x - x0))) # We minimize the square of the distance here
@constraint(projection, x0' * a == b)                  # Point must lie on the hyperplane

#' ## Euclidean Distance Between Polyhedra
#' Given two polyhedra $C = \{x | A_{1} \cdot x \leq b1\}$ and $D = \{x | A_{2} \cdot x \leq b_{2}\}$, 
#' the distance between them is the optimal value of the problem:

#' $$
#' \begin{align*}
#' \min && ||x - y|| \\
#' s.t. && A_{1} \cdot x \leq b_{1} \\
#' && A_{2} \cdot y \leq b_{2} 
#' \end{align*}
#' $$

#' ## Linear Placement Problem
#' We have $N$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and a list of pairs of points that must be connected by links. 
#' The positions of some of the $N$ points are fixed; our task is to determine the positions of the remaining points, 
#' i.e., to place the remaining points. The objective is to place the points so that the distance between the links is minimized, 
#' i.e. our objective is:

#' $$
#' \begin{align*}
#' \min && \sum_{(i,j) \in A}||p_{i} - p_{j}|| 
#' \end{align*}

#' ## Floor Planning
#' A floor planning problem consists of rectangles or boxes aligned with the axes which must be placed, 
#' within some limits such that they do not overlap. The objective is usually to minimize the size 
#' (e.g., area, volume, perimeter) of the bounding box, which is the smallest box that contains the boxes to be configured and placed.
#' We model this problem as follows:

#' We have N boxes $B_{1}, . . . , B_{N}$ that are to be configured and placed in a rectangle with width $W$ and height $H$, 
#' and lower left corner at the position $(0, 0)$. The geometry and position of the $i$th box is specified by 
#' its width $w_{i}$ and height $h_{i}$, and the coordinates $(x_{i}, y_{i})$ of its lower left corner.

#' The variables in the problem are $x_{i}, y_{i}, w_{i}, h_{i}$ for $i=1, \ldots, 
#' N,$ and the width $W$ and height $H$ of the bounding rectangle. In all floor planning problems, 
#' we require that the cells lie inside the bounding rectangle, $i . e .$

#' $$
#' x_{i} \geq 0, \quad y_{i} \geq 0, \quad x_{i}+w_{i} \leq W, \quad y_{i}+h_{i} \leq H, \quad i=1, \ldots, N
#' $$

#' We also require that the cells do not overlap, except possibly on their boundaries, i.e.

#' $$
#' x_{i}+w_{i} \leq x_{j} \quad \text{or} \quad x_{j}+w_{j} \leq x_{i} \quad \text{or} \quad y_{i}+h_{j} \leq y_{j} \quad \text{or} \quad y_{j}+h_{i} \leq y_{i}

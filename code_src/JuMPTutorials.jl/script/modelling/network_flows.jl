#' In graph theory, a flow network (also known as a transportation network) is a directed graph where 
#' each edge has a capacity and each edge receives a flow. The amount of flow on an edge cannot exceed the capacity of the edge. 
#' Often in operations research, a directed graph is called a network, the vertices are called nodes and the edges are called arcs. 
#' A flow must satisfy the restriction that the amount of flow into a node equals the amount of flow out of it, 
#' unless it is a source, which has only outgoing flow, or sink, which has only incoming flow. 
#' A network can be used to model traffic in a computer network, circulation with demands, fluids in pipes, 
#' currents in an electrical circuit, or anything similar in which something travels through a network of nodes.

#' ## The Shortest Path Problem
#' Suppose that each arc $(i, j)$ of a graph is assigned a scalar cost $a_{i,j}$, and 
#' suppose that we define the cost of a forward path to be the sum of the costs of its arcs. 
#' Given a pair of nodes, the shortest path problem is to find a forward path that connects these nodes and has minimum cost.

#' $$
#' \begin{align*}
#' \min && \sum_{\forall e(i,j) \in E} a_{i,j} \times x_{i,j} \\
#' s.t. && b(i) = \sum_j x_{ij} - \sum_k x_{ki} = \begin{cases}
#' 1 &\mbox{if $i$ is the starting node,} \\
#' -1 &\mbox{if $i$ is the ending node,} \\
#' 0 &\mbox{otherwise.} \end{cases} \\
#' && x_{e} \in \{0,1\} && \forall e \in E
#' \end{align*}

#' ## The Assignment Problem
#' Suppose that there are $n$ persons and $n$ objects that we have to match on a one-to-one basis. 
#' There is a benefit or value $a_{i,j}$ for matching person $i$ with object $j$, and 
#' we want to assign persons to objects so as to maximize the total benefit. 
#' There is also a restriction that person $i$ can be assigned to object $j$ only if $(i, j)$ belongs to a given set of pairs $A$. 
#' Mathematically, we want to find a set of person-object pairs $(1, j_{1}),..., (n, j_{n})$ from $A$ such that 
#' the objects $j_{1},...,j_{n}$ are all distinct, and the total benefit $\sum_{i=1}^{y} a_{ij_{i}}$ is maximized.

#' $$
#' \begin{align*}
#' \max && \sum_{(i,j) \in A} a_{i,j} \times y_{i,j} \\
#' s.t. && \sum_{\{j|(i,j) \in A\}} y_{i,j} = 1 && \forall i = \{1,2....n\} \\
#' && \sum_{\{i|(i,j) \in A\}} y_{i,j} = 1 && \forall j = \{1,2....n\} \\
#' && y_{i,j} \in \{0,1\} && \forall (i,j) \in \{1,2...k\}
#' \end{align*}

#' ## The Max-Flow Problem
#' In the max-flow problem, we have a graph with two special nodes: the $source$, denoted by $s$, and the $sink$, denoted by $t$. 
#' The objective is to move as much flow as possible from $s$ into $t$ while observing the capacity constraints.

#' \max && \sum_{v:(s,v) \in E} f(s,v) \\
#' s.t. && \sum_{u:(u,v) \in E} f(u,v)  = \sum_{w:(v,w) \in E} f(v,w) && \forall v \in V - \{s,t\} \\
